# Crate-maid

"Crate-maid" is a project created at the Liege Hackerspace. It is a robot made up of a Club-Maté crate, hoverboard wheels, and a PS-Eye camera, the purpose of which is yet to be defined.

The main goal is to implement a control method for the robot that allows it to be directed to a specific location using ArUco tags to identify intersections and possible destinations, while following a black line.
